## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1. 🛒 Market Basket Analysis
**Goal**: Discover purchase patterns from a supermarket dataset.  
**Techniques Used**:
- Apriori Algorithm for association rule mining
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Lift metric to measure item correlation  
**Result**: Found strong associations (lift > 1) between items, helping inform better product placement and recommendation strategies.  
> **Max Lift Achieved**: 22.8

### 2. 🧬 Diabetes Prediction using Naive Bayes
**Goal**: Predict whether a person has diabetes using health metrics.  
**Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
**Models Used**:
- Naive Bayes (Best: **Accuracy 0.77**, **F1-score 0.81**)
- Random Forest (Accuracy 0.72, F1-score 0.78)  
**Process**:
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison  
> **Conclusion**: Naive Bayes slightly outperformed Random Forest.

### 3. 📰 Fake News Sentiment Analysis
**Goal**: Classify news articles as real or fake.  
**Techniques Used**:
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  
**Result**: BoW with Naive Bayes gave best performance. TF-IDF was useful but less accurate.  
> **Challenge**: Missing labels were resolved through data consolidation.
